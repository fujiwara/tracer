# tracer

tracer is a tracing tool for Amazon ECS tasks.

tracer shows events and logs of the tasks order by timestamp.

## Install

```console
$ brew install fujiwara/tap/tracer
```

[Binary Releases](https://github.com/fujiwara/tracer/releases)

## Usage

### as a CLI

```
Usage of tracer:
tracer [options] [cluster] [task-id]

  -duration duration
        fetch logs duration from created / before stopping (default 1m0s)
  -version
    	show the version 
```

Environment variable `AWS_REGION` is required.

- `tracer` (no arguments) shows list of clusters.
- `tracer {cluster}` shows all tasks in the clusters.
- `tracer {cluster} {task-id}` shows a tracing logs of the task.


### as a Lambda function

`tracer` also runs on AWS Lambda functions invoked by EventBridge's "ECS Task State Change" events.

1. Put a `tracer` binary into a lambda function's archive(zip) as `bootstrap` named.
1. Set to call the lambda function by EvnetBridge rule as below.
   ```json
   {
     "source": ["aws.ecs"],
     "detail-type": ["ECS Task State Change"]
   }
   ```
1. The tracer lambda function will put trace logs when ECS tasks STOPPED.

See also [lambda directory](lambda/).

### IAM permissions

tracer requires IAM permissions as below.

- `ecs:Describe*`
- `ecs:List*`
- `logs:GetLog*`

See also [example.tf](lambda/example.tf).
